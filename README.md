## Animal Sound Classifier

This project is for **CSCI 6366: Neural Networks & Deep Learning** at The George Washington University.

We build deep learning models to classify animal sounds (**dog**, **cat**, **bird**) from short audio clips using:

- Mel-spectrograms and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Hybrid **CRNN** architectures (CNN + GRU)
- Sequence models based on **Vision Transformers (ViT)** over spectrogram "images"
- Transfer learning with pre-trained audio models such as **YAMNet**

The end goal is to build a clean, reproducible pipeline and compare a simple CNN baseline against more advanced architectures and transfer-learning–based approaches.

Properties:

- Mono `.wav` file
- Automatically resampled to **16 kHz**
- ~1 second duration
- Converted into **128×128 Mel-spectrograms**

## Environment & Setup

- **Python**: 3.10+ recommended
- **Key packages**:
  - `tensorflow>=2.16,<3`
  - `librosa`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow_hub` (for YAMNet transfer learning)

Install dependencies (example with `pip`):

```bash
pip install "tensorflow>=2.16,<3" librosa numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow_hub
```

Place the dataset under `data/` with subfolders `dog/`, `cat/`, and `bird/` so that paths look like:

```text
audio-classification-cnn/
  data/
    dog/*.wav
    cat/*.wav
    bird/*.wav
```

Then you can open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code and run them end-to-end.

## Modeling Pipeline (Current Baseline)

At a high level, the baseline Mel-spectrogram → CNN pipeline does:

1. **Load audio**
   - Use `librosa.load(path, sr=16000)` to get a mono waveform at 16 kHz.
2. **Compute Mel-spectrogram**
   - Parameters: `n_fft=1024`, `hop_length=512`, `n_mels=128`, `power=2.0`.
   - Convert the power spectrogram to dB with `librosa.power_to_db`.
3. **Fix the input size**
   - Start with shape `(128, T)` (mel bands × time frames).
   - Center-crop or right-pad along the time axis to get `(128, 128)`.
4. **Normalize & reshape**
   - Per-example min–max normalization to \([0, 1]\).
   - Add a channel dimension → `(128, 128, 1)` (a grayscale "image").
5. **Label encoding**
   - Map classes `["dog", "cat", "bird"]` to indices `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - Use one-hot vectors of length 3 for training.
6. **Train / val / test splits**
   - Stratified splits with `train_test_split` to create:
     - A **held-out test set** never seen during training.
     - Separate **train** and **validation** sets.
7. **CNN model (Keras)**
   - Input: `(128, 128, 1)`
   - Conv2D(32, 3×3, relu, same) → MaxPooling2D(2×2)
   - Conv2D(64, 3×3, relu, same) → MaxPooling2D(2×2)
   - Flatten → Dense(64, relu) → Dense(3, softmax)
   - Compile with `optimizer="adam"`, `loss="categorical_crossentropy"`, `metrics=["accuracy"]`.

All of this is implemented and demonstrated in `02_cnn_baseline.ipynb`.

## Baseline Results (Small Dataset)

From early runs on a small subset of the data (using the explicit train/val/test split in `02_cnn_baseline.ipynb`):

- **Training accuracy** ≈ **0.89**
- **Validation accuracy** ≈ **0.60**
- **Test accuracy** ≈ **0.42** on a small held-out set.

These numbers indicate that:

- The CNN can fit the training data reasonably well.
- It performs clearly above random guessing (1/3) on validation/test.
- There is some overfitting, which is expected given the relatively small dataset and simple regularization.

---

## Final CNN Model and Results (Full Dataset)

We trained several CNN architectures on Mel-spectrograms of animal sounds (dog / cat / bird). Using the full dataset (610 audio clips) and a stratified train/val/test split (440 / 78 / 92), our best model is:

- **CNN + Dropout(0.5)**  
  Conv2D(32) → MaxPool → Conv2D(64) → MaxPool → Conv2D(128) → MaxPool → Flatten → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(3, Softmax)

**Test set performance (on 92 held-out clips):**

- Accuracy ≈ **92%**
- Test Loss ≈ **0.24**
- Balanced performance across all three classes (dog, cat, bird)

Compared to the baseline CNN without Dropout, the regularized model achieves higher test accuracy (~92% vs ~90%) and significantly lower test loss (0.24 vs 0.57), indicating better model calibration and reduced overfitting.

**📓 Final Submission Notebook:** See `notebooks/FINAL_project_submission.ipynb` for the complete project with all experiments, results, and conclusions consolidated into a single comprehensive notebook.

See `04_cnn_full_data.ipynb` for detailed CNN experiments and `06_transfer_learning_yamnet_embeddings.ipynb` for transfer learning results.

## Additional Architectures: CRNN and ViT

In addition to the CNN models above, we explored more advanced architectures in separate notebooks.

### CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)

**Notebook:** `02_crnn_explore.ipynb`

**Input:** 128×128 Mel-spectrograms, reshaped to `(time, freq, 1)`

**Architecture:**

- **CNN feature extractor:**
  - Conv2D(32) → BatchNorm → MaxPool
  - Conv2D(64) → BatchNorm → MaxPool
  - Conv2D(128) → BatchNorm → MaxPool
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D to collapse spatial features
  - Lambda layer to wrap into a sequence: `(batch, 1, features)`
- **Bidirectional GRU(128)** → Dropout(0.3)
- **Dense(3, softmax)** classifier

**Results (80/20 train/validation split):**

- Validation accuracy ≈ **78.69%**
- Training accuracy quickly reaches ~100%, while validation accuracy stabilizes around 78–79%, indicating some overfitting but good performance.

The CRNN shows that adding temporal modeling with GRUs can reach competitive performance, but it does not surpass our best CNN+Dropout model (~88% test accuracy).

### Vision Transformer (ViT)-style Classifier

**Notebook:** `02_ViT_exlore.ipynb`

**Input:** 128×128 Mel-spectrograms treated as images

**Architecture:**

- Custom `PatchLayer` to extract non-overlapping 16×16 patches
- `PatchEmbedding` layer to project patches and add positional embeddings
- Stack of Transformer encoder blocks:
  - Multi-head self-attention
  - Feed-forward layers with LayerNorm and Dropout
- GlobalAveragePooling1D over patch tokens
- Dropout(0.3) → Dense(3, softmax)

**Results (80/20 train/validation split):**

- Validation accuracy ≈ **35–40%**, close to random guessing.
- Loss remains around ~1.09–1.12, indicating the model underfits the dataset.

The ViT experiment suggests that, under our data and compute constraints, a transformer trained from scratch on spectrogram patches is harder to optimize than a simple CNN or CRNN, and requires more data and careful tuning.

| Model                  | Test Accuracy | Test Loss | Notes                |
| ---------------------- | ------------: | --------: | -------------------- |
| Baseline CNN           |         ~90% |     ~0.57 | Trained from scratch |
| **CNN + Dropout(0.5)** |    **~92%** |     **~0.24** | **Best model**       |
| YAMNet + Dense Head    |         ~66% |     ~0.96 | Transfer learning    |

## **Key finding**: Training a CNN from scratch on Mel-spectrograms achieved ~92% accuracy, significantly outperforming transfer learning with YAMNet (~66%). This demonstrates that transfer learning is not always better—it depends on the task, dataset size, and domain alignment. See `FINAL_project_submission.ipynb` for complete analysis and conclusions.

## Transfer Learning Results (YAMNet)

We experimented with transfer learning using pre-trained YAMNet embeddings in two notebooks:

### Notebook 05: YAMNet with Averaged Embeddings

**Notebook:** `05_transfer_learning.ipynb`

For each audio clip:

1. Load waveform at 16 kHz
2. Run YAMNet to obtain frame-level 1024-D embeddings
3. **Average embeddings over time** to get a single 1024-D vector per clip
4. Train a small classifier head:
   - Dense(128, ReLU) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(3, softmax)

**Results:**

- Test accuracy ≈ **62%**

### Notebook 06: YAMNet with Full Sequence Embeddings

**Notebook:** `06_transfer_learning_yamnet_embeddings.ipynb`

This notebook improves on Notebook 05 by preserving temporal information:

1. Load waveform at 16 kHz
2. Run YAMNet to obtain frame-level 1024-D embeddings
3. **Preserve full sequence** of embeddings (T frames × 1024 dims)
4. Pad/truncate to fixed length (100 frames × 1024 dims)
5. Flatten and train a Dense classifier:
   - Flatten → Dense(16, ReLU) → Dropout(0.1) → Dense(16, ReLU) → Dropout(0.1) → Dense(16, ReLU) → Dense(3, softmax)

**Results:**

- Test accuracy ≈ **66%** (improvement over averaged approach)
- Shows that preserving temporal information helps, but still below CNN performance

**Key Finding:** While preserving temporal information improves transfer learning performance (~66% vs ~62%), training from scratch on Mel-spectrograms with a task-specific CNN still significantly outperforms both transfer learning approaches (~92% vs ~66%).

## Overall Comparison

| Model                  |      Metric Split |   Accuracy | Test Loss | Notes                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------: | ---------: | --------: | ------------------------------------------- |
| Baseline CNN           |  Test (full data) |      ~90% |     ~0.57 | Trained from scratch                        |
| **CNN + Dropout(0.5)** |  Test (full data) | **~92%** |    **~0.24** | **Best model**                              |
| CRNN (CNN + BiGRU)     | Val (80/20 split) |    ~78.69% |     ~0.80 | Validation metrics only                     |
| YAMNet (Full Sequence) |  Test (full data) |       ~66% |     ~0.96 | Transfer learning - preserves temporal info |
| YAMNet (Averaged)      |  Test (full data) |      ~62% |     ~0.90 | Transfer learning from AudioSet             |
| ViT-style Transformer  | Val (80/20 split) |    ~35–40% |     ~1.10 | Validation metrics only                     |

**Note:** Macro F1 is reported only for models evaluated on test sets. Models evaluated on validation sets (CRNN, ViT) show "–" as Macro F1 was not calculated for those experiments.

**Key findings:**

- Training a CNN from scratch on Mel-spectrograms achieved **~92% accuracy**, significantly outperforming both transfer learning (YAMNet ~66%) and more complex architectures (CRNN, ViT) on this specific task.
- Regularization with Dropout(0.5) improved test loss from 0.57 to 0.24, indicating better model calibration.
- The CRNN achieves good validation accuracy (~78.69%) and shows that temporal modeling can work well, but it does not beat the simpler CNN+Dropout model.
- The ViT-style model underfits and behaves close to random guessing, highlighting the challenge of training transformer models from scratch on small audio datasets.
- Transfer learning is not automatically better; it depends on dataset size, domain alignment, and how well the pre-trained model's embeddings match the target task.
