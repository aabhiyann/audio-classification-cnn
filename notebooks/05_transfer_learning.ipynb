    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we extend our previous experiments (02–04) by using\n",
    "**transfer learning** with a pre-trained audio model, **YAMNet**, to classify\n",
    "animal sounds (`dog`, `cat`, `bird`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training a CNN from scratch on Mel-spectrograms, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a pre-trained YAMNet model (trained on AudioSet) to extract\n",
    "   high-level audio **embeddings** from each waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train a small neural network (Dense layers) **on top of these embeddings**\n",
    "   to classify our three animal classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare this transfer-learning approach to our best CNN from\n",
    "   `04_cnn_full_data.ipynb` (CNN + Dropout 0.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reuse the same dataset and class labels as before.\n",
    "- Keep a similar **train/validation/test split** (stratified, random_state=42).\n",
    "- Evaluate test accuracy, confusion matrix, and per-class metrics.\n",
    "- Discuss how transfer learning compares to our custom CNN models.\n"
